# Problem 2-Thermal and Tracer Diffusion (EOS7R/rdif7)

This problem is prepared to illustrate thermal and tracer diffusion. It was originally present in TOUGH3/EOS7R user manual (rdif7). There are in fact two independent flow problems in two separate 1-D grid systems, each with 1 $$m^2$$ cross sectional area and 2 m long, divided into 20 grid blocks of 0.1 m length.&#x20;

The “A-grid” (blocks A 1 through AJJ20) is initialized in single phase liquid conditions with default parameters of P = 105 Pa, T = 8 ˚C, and zero mass fractions for brine, Rn1, Rn2, and air. Boundary conditions provided by block “ina 1” with a very large volume are (P, Xb, XRn1, XRn2, X, T) = (105, 10-3, 10-7, 10-8, 10-6, 9 ˚C). The radionuclide tracers are stable (half-life of 1050 seconds). Rn1 with an inverse Henry’s constant of 105 Pa-1 has low volatility, while Rn2 is a volatile species with the same inverse Henry’s constant as air, 10-10 Pa-1. Diffusivities specified in data block DIFFU override parameters in block SELEC; all diffusivities are specified as -1.e-6 so that, for all components, mass diffusion occurs with saturation and tortuosity-independent effective diffusivities of 10-6 m2/s. In addition to mass diffusion, there is also thermal diffusion due to the different temperature at the boundary. Thermal diffusivity is dth = /C ≈ 2.5/(2500x1000) = 10-6 m2/s, equal to component diffusivities. Porosity was chosen to be small,  = 10-4, so that fluid contributions to formation specific heat are small. This parametrization allows a direct comparison between changes for mass fractions and temperatures. The “B-grid” (B 1 through B 20) is initialized in single-phase gas conditions at the same pressure of 105 Pa, but at a temperature of 125 ˚C, and also with zero mass fractions of all components other than water. Different non-zero mass fractions for the various components are specified in block “ina 2” with a very large volume at the boundary of the B-grid.
