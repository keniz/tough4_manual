# Adjustment of Computing Parameters at Run-time

TOUGH4 allows adjustment of several key computing parameters or temporary monitoring of variables at an element or connection during run-time. These parameters include:  simulation end time (SimulationTimeEnd), maximum time-step size (MaxTimeStep), relative Newton iteration convergence criteria (rel\_convergence\_crit), absolute Newton iteration convergence criteria (abs\_convergence\_crit), maximum primary variable change criteria for Newton iteration convergence (pv\_convergence\_cr1, pv\_convergence\_cr2, pv\_convergence\_cr3), maximum number of  time steps (Max\_NumTimeSteps), maximum number of Newton iterations (Max\_NumNRIterations), maximum number of Newton iterations for increasing time step size (MOP\_16), frequency for writing SAVE file (SAVE\_frequency), frequency for writing time-series output file (TimeSeries\_frequency), monitoring of simulation results at a given element (monitoringElem) or connection (monitoringConn) by providing the element name and/or connection name. The simulation results of primary variables, phase state, fluxes at the connection will be written out for the provided monitoring element/connection. &#x20;

The parameter changes or giving an element or connection name for monitoring are through a text file named "Parameter\_Update\_File". Figure 29 shows the contents of this file.

A template of this file was included in the software distribution package. Users need copy it to the working folder where the model input files are located. TOUGH4 will scan this file during run-time for every given time-steps (scan frequency). If it was changed, the new parameters will be read and replace the model input values. Only the file updated after the start of running simulation will take effect.   Users may adjust the parameters multiple times in one simulation run.  If a parameter does not change, one may leave the input parameter empty.  As these computing parameters are sensitive to the simulation performance, an error value may lead to unpredictable model running behavior. Users should make the parameter adjustments carefully. &#x20;

The default frequency for scanning the file "Parameter\_Update\_File" is 1000 time-steps per scan. Users may use IE(30) to increase or decrease the scanning frequency. &#x20;
